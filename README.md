 
Templates used in combination with [Scholdoc](http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com/) to get rid of LaTeX on the writers' side, while matching exactly the look and feel of the original formats. 

A bit hackish in the background (still rely on pdflatex/bibtex for perfect references); currently only SIGCHI Paper Format -- tested on linux and windows platforms.
